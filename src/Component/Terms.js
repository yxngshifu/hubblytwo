          <p className='py-2 px-10 text-justify'>
           
           Hubbly operates the Platform, which enables Hubblers to be put in contact with Hubblees, so that they can receive At-home Services.
Hubbly’s responsibility is limited to its role as operator of the Platform. To the extent permitted by law, Hubbly is not responsible for the provision of At-home Services by any Hubbler.
Accordingly, these T&Cs do not govern the relationship between a Hubblee and a Hubbler for the provision of At-home Services. A separate contract is entered into between a Hubblee and a Hubbler for the provision of the At-home Services.
The purpose of these T&Cs is to define the terms of access and use of the Platform, as well as to set out the rights and obligations of Hubbly, the Hubblers and Hubblees in relation to the use of the Platform (the “T&C Agreement” ).
Please read these T&Cs carefully before you create an Account with Hubbly. These T&Cs tell you who we are, how we will provide services to you, how you and we may change or end the T&C Agreement, what to do if there is a problem and other important information. Let us know if anything is unclear or you have any questions.
How to contact us. You can contact us by telephoning our Hubblee service team at [033 050 0916] (tel:+4433 050 0916) or writing to us at admin@hubbly.me

            The Hubblee can create their Account and sign up to the Platform via 
(i) the Website, when making a Booking or by clicking on "Create my account" in the "Sign In" tab, or via the 
(ii) Application, when making a Booking.

When creating an Account, the Hubblee agrees to read the T&Cs which they consent to by ticking the box "I accept the terms and conditions". The Hubblee is free to accept or refuse the T&Cs. If the Hubblee refuses to accept the T&Cs, Hubbly will not provide any Hubbly Services.
From the moment the Hubblee accepts the T&Cs and/or as the result of making a Booking, the Hubblee receives an email confirming the Account has been created.
          </p>

 <h1 className='text-[#048392] px-10'>4. Registration Conditions Specific to Hubblers.</h1>
 <p className='py-2 px-10  text-justify'>
  To complete the registration process and start offering At-home Services through Hubbly, Hubblers must provide the following information to Hubbly (in addition to the details provided during initial sign-up, as outlined in clause 3.2):
 <ul className='py-2 px-6 text-justify list-disc'>
              <li className=' py-2'>

               </li>
               </ul>
Hubblers acknowledge and agree that Hubbly may request their participation in a phone interview and skill verification process, which may include taking an assessment test. Hubbly reserves the right to reject a Hubbler's registration without providing justification.


 </p>
 <h1 className='text-[#048392] px-10'>5. Development of Hubbly Services and Modification of T&Cs</h1>
<p className='py-2 px-10  text-justify'>
   Hubbly is dedicated to enhancing the quality and functionality of its platform and services continuously.
Hubbly reserves the right to unilaterally modify the Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) and/or Hubbly Services concerning technical aspects of the platform and services, such as implementing new user features or security enhancements, without prior notice, as long as these changes do not result in a price increase or degrade service quality, and as long as the user's agreed-upon aspects are maintained as per the T&Cs.
For any other modifications to the T&Cs and Hubbly Services, Hubbly will provide notice to the user via email and/or within the platform at least 15 days before the changes take effect.
If the user does not object to the modifications during this period, Hubbly will assume the user has reviewed and accepted the changes. In the event of user objection or refusal, the T&C Agreement will terminate upon the effective date of the modified terms and/or services, and the user will no longer have access to the platform and Hubbly Services. However, termination is contingent upon the fulfilment of any ongoing obligations (e.g., honouring existing bookings) before the modification's effective date.

</p>
 <h1 className='text-[#048392] px-10'>6. Account Access, Use and Security
</h1>
<p className='py-2 px-10  text-justify'>
   Access to the Platform and Hubbly Services is for Users only. Every User understands and accepts that they are responsible for the access to, and use of, their Account. Each User agrees to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date information in their Account.
A User must be at least 18 years of age to create an Account and to Access the Platform and Hubbly Services.
Except in the event of technical failure by Hubbly or in the case of events outside a User’s reasonable control, every User is responsible for protecting their sign-in information and must take all reasonable measures to ensure the safeguarding and confidentiality of their sign-in data (including user ID and passwords).
If they have reasons to believe that their sign-in data (in particular, their user ID or password) has been lost, stolen, misused or compromised in any way, or in the event of unauthorised use of their Account, the User must immediately inform Hubbly.
In such a situation, the User authorises Hubbly to undertake any appropriate measures to prevent any further unauthorised access to the Account.

</p>
<h1 className='text-[#048392] px-10'>7. Provision of At-home Services</h1>
<p className='py-2 px-10  text-justify'>
    <h1 className=' py-2'>7.1 Booking</h1>
The Hubblee can make Bookings on the Website or Application. They must select one or several At-home Services from the categories of At-home Services offered and fill out their desired date and time.
The At-home Services can only be provided during the hours indicated on the Website and Application. The At-home Services provided at certain times may be subject to an additional cost, as indicated on the Website and Application at the time of making the Booking.
Before validating the Booking, the Hubblee has access to a summary of it and can indicate any special requests or provide directions to the Hubbler who will be selected. The Hubblee understands and accepts that any such requests or directions are given as a guide and may not be agreed to by the Hubbler.
The Hubblee and the Hubbler can mutually agree to modify a Booking before the scheduled date of the At-home Service.
<h1 className=' py-2'>7.2 Connecting Hubblees and Hubblers
</h1>
After validation, the Booking is sent (using Hubbly's algorithm) to available Hubblers who best meet the Hubblee's request. A Booking is considered as validated once a Hubbler accepts it.
Hubbly selects a Hubbler for the Hubblee using a ranking score which varies according to the following criteria:
the Hubblers' ability to create Hubblee loyalty (for example, the regularity with which Hubblees rebook with a Hubbler within a 6 month-period following a Booking);
the Hubblers' score as given by the Hubblees; and
the number of Bookings cancelled by the Hubbler.
The At-home Services are also assigned according to the location of Hubblers and Hubblees.
When the Hubbler receives an At-home Service offer, they are free to accept or refuse it, by using the corresponding feature on the Platform. If the Hubbler does not respond to the At-home Service offer within the deadline stated, the Hubbler will be deemed to have refused the offer.
As soon as a Booking is made, Hubbly contacts several Hubblers. The Hubblers contacted first are those who have high scores based on the criteria listed above. The more urgent the Booking, the quicker Hubbler will be contacted in order to fulfil the Booking.
In the absence of a reply from a Hubbler in the time period based on the urgency of a Booking, the Booking is then offered to other Hubblers, until it is accepted by one of them.
The first Hubbler contacted who accepts the Booking receives that Booking.
<h1 className=' py-2'>7.3 Withdrawal and Cancellation of Bookings
</h1>
When a Booking is validated more than 14 days in advance in accordance with the clause above, the Hubblee benefits from the right to withdraw as provided by the law. To do this, the Hubblee can cancel the Booking on the Platform, by using the corresponding feature on the Website or Application, and the Booking will be cancelled at no cost.
When a Booking is validated less than 14 days in advance in accordance with the clause above, the Hubblee requires that the provision of services begins and is completed before the end of the withdrawal period. In this respect, the Hubblee expressly opts out of their right to withdraw.
In any event and for all Bookings, the following cancellation rules apply:
cancellation more than 24 hours before the scheduled appointment: no cancellation fees;
cancellation between 8 and 24 hours before the scheduled appointment: a flat-rate cancellation fee of five pounds (£5);
cancellation between 4 and 8 hours before the scheduled appointment: a flat-rate cancellation fee of ten pounds (£10);
cancellation between 2 and 4 hours before the scheduled appointment: cancellation fee of 50% of the Booking amount, up to a maximum of twenty pounds (£20);
cancellation between 2 hours and the time of the scheduled appointment: cancellation fee of 80% of the Booking amount, up to a maximum of thirty pounds (£30); and
cancellation after the scheduled appointment, or when the Hubblee has not arrived 30 minutes after the appointment time: 100% of the Booking amount, up to a maximum of forty pounds (£40).
<h1 className=' py-2'>7.4 the process for at - home service

</h1>
Hubbly has no involvement in providing the At-home Service itself, which is delivered by the Hubbler.
At the end of an At-home Service, the Hubblee rates the Hubbler using a scoring system. The ratings are considered final and are only deleted in exceptional cases, following an explicit request from the author. Overall Hubbler ratings are shown on the Platform.
The Hubbler also rates the Hubblee. The ratings provided by the Hubblers are not shown on the Platform.
</p>
<h1 className='text-[#048392] px-10'>8. Financial Terms</h1>
<p className='py-2 px-10  text-justify'>
    <h1 className=' py-2'>8.1 PRICES FOR AT-HOME SERVICES</h1>
The price for At-home Services is set by Hubbly. The price of each specific At-home Service is indicated on the Platform. Hubbly may change the price of At-home Services set on the Platform from time to time without prior notice. However Hubbly will never change the price of a Booking following acceptance on the Platform.
The Hubblee must pay for the At-home Services by card.
The Hubbler's payment corresponds to the amount which is offered to them by Hubbly before they accept an At-home Service. Hubbly will not change the amount offered to the Hubbler by Hubbly for an At-home Service once this Booking has been accepted.
Hubbly’s payment for the provision of Hubbly Services corresponds to the difference between the price accepted by the Hubbler and the price paid by the Hubblee.
The Hubblee understands and accepts that in the case of certain At-home Services a minimum Booking value applies. Where this is the case, this is indicated on the Platform.
   <h1 className=' py-2'>8.2 PAYMENT OF AT-HOME SERVICES</h1>
   For managing cash flows, Hubbly uses Revolut, a third party payment services provider which sells a solution enabling the management of payment flows between Hubbly, the Hubblers and the Hubblees. The payment services provided by Revolut are subject to the terms and conditions of the product "Revolut Merchant API" and are available at the following address: https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant/merchant-api . By using the Platform, you acknowledge that these Revolut terms apply to how payments are made and will apply, to the extent applicable, to Hubblers and Hubblees.
The price of At-home Services is subject to a bank pre-authorisation from the Hubblee’s account 24 hours before the start of the At-home Service and is debited from the Hubblee within 24 hours after the provision of the At-home Service. Hubbly gives instructions to Revolut for the corresponding amounts due to the Hubbler to be transferred to the Hubbler on a weekly basis by default. The instructions are given on the day notified to the Hubbler by Hubbly. Alternatively, a Hubbler may request to receive money due monthly. Following Hubblys’s instruction an additional period of eight (8) days is then required to transfer the funds.
<h1 className=' py-2'>8.3 INVOICING</h1>
The invoices the Hubblee receives for At-home Services, as well as the invoices related to Hubbly Services, are available in the Hubblee's Account in the days following the provision of the At-home Service. The Hubblee can also download the invoices, [which enables them to receive a personal services credit tax for eligible fields of work. The Hubblee will also have access to a tax certificate.]
The invoices generated for the Hubbler Account in accordance with the invoicing agreement stated below, and the invoices for the payment of Hubbly Services, are sent to the Hubbler by email in the 4 days following the provision of the At-home Service.
<h1 className=' py-2'>8.4 INVOICING AGREEMENT</h1>
The Hubbler expressly gives Hubbly (which accepts it) the right to establish invoices in their name and for their account, in relation to At-home Services.
It is hereby stated that the Hubbler remains fully responsible for their legal and tax obligations with regard to invoicing for the original invoices issued in their name and for their account by Hubbly, particularly with regard to their VAT obligations.
The invoicing agreement is effective during the entire period in which the T&Cs are in force between the Hubbler and Hubbly. Hubbly and the Hubbler are both required to keep a copy of the invoices.
For the purposes of the agreement, the Hubbler must provide Hubbly with the following information, depending on their situation:
 <ul className='py-2 px-6 text-justify list-disc'>
              <li className=' py-2'>
                Name and surname / or company name.

<p className='px-10'>
    <h1 className=' py-2 '>10.1 Hubbly’s liability to HUBBLEE
</h1>
Hubbly is an operator of an online platform and is not responsible to Hubblees for a Hubbler’s provision of At-home Services. This is detailed further below.
To the extent permitted by law, Hubbly is not liable to Hubblees for the following:
any theft or loss of property in connection with the Hubbly Services.
any loss, damage, expenses or liability suffered by any third party in connection with the Hubblee’s use of the Platform.
any loss as a result of temporary access difficulties or other inability by the Hubblee in using the Platform, the Account or Hubbly Services.
any loss which is the result of an error by the Hubblee, circumstances outside of Hubbly’s control (even if we have taken reasonable care, such as disruptions in third party telecommunication networks) or due to the inherent limitations of the operation of an online service; or
any other loss, damage, costs or liability of the Hubblee in connection with the Hubbly Services, except if this is caused by a failure of Hubbly to deliver the Hubbly Services with the reasonable skill and care expected of a provider of similar digital intermediary services.
The Hubblee should be aware that Hubbly only supplies the Hubbly Services for domestic and private use. If a Hubblee uses the products for any commercial, business or re-sale purpose, Hubbly will have no liability to a Hubblee for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.
If Hubbly could be held liable to Hubblees, damages are limited by law to those losses which are either (i) obvious to both parties that such loss could happen, or (ii) at the time of entering into the contract, both Hubbly and the Hubblee knew that a specific loss might happen (for example, if the Hubblee had highlighted and discussed a particular concern with Hubbly during the booking process).
Nothing in these T&Cs limits or excludes Hubbly’s liability to a Hubblee for personal injury or death caused by Hubbly’s negligence.
  <h1 className=' py-2'>10.2 HUBBLY’S LIABILITY TO HUBBLERS

To the extent permitted by law, Hubbly is not liable to Hubblers for the following:

 <li className=' py-2'>any other loss, damage, costs or liability incurred by the Hubbler in connection with the Hubbly Services, save to the extent that this is due to a failure of Hubbly to perform its obligations in delivering the Hubbly Services with reasonable skill and care to the standard of a professional provider of similar digital intermediary services.
</li>In the event where Hubbly is held and proven liable to Hubblers, its liability is limited to an amount equal to the total cost of the At-home Service in aggregate.
Nothing in these T&Cs limits or excludes Hubbly’s liability to a Hubbler for personal injury or death caused directly by Hubbly’s negligence.

<h1 className='text-[#048392] px-10'>12. USER RESPONSIBILITIES
</h1>
<p>
    The User is responsible for their use of the Platform and Hubbly Services; therefore, they are liable for any damage they may cause as a result of their behaviour, or inaccurate, incomplete and/or misleading information which they provide when signing up to the Platform, or by not updating this information, all of which they alone bear the consequences.
More specifically, Users are responsible for:
the information they choose to upload into their Account and that they share by using the Platform and Hubbly Services; and
the negotiation, outcome and execution of contracts which take place between Users for the provision of At-home Services, as Hubbly is solely a digital contact platform.
</p>
<h1 className='text-[#048392] px-10'>13. DURATION, SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION
</h1>
<h1 className=' py-2'>13.1 Duration of T&CS
</h1>
<p>
    The T&C Agreement comes into force once the User has accepted these T&Cs and remains in force until it is modified (see clause 5 above) or terminated (see clause 13.3 below).
<h1 className=' py-2'>13.2 Account Restrictions for Hubblers
</h1>
<h1 className=' py-2'>13.2.1 Manual restrictions
</h1>
The Account and Hubbly Services given to the Hubblers can be restricted for a period not to exceed one (1) month, in the following cases:
<ul className='py-2 px-6 text-justify list-disc'>
              <li className=' py-2'>
               the Hubbler has sent unkind or aggressive messages to the Hubbly teams.
              </li>
<li className=' py-2'>
the Hubbler has behaved in an unkind or aggressive manner towards Hubblees.
</li>
<li className=' py-2'>
the Hubbler has repeatedly received negative reviews from Hubblees.
</li>
<li className=' py-2'>
the Hubbler has not informed a Hubblee in advance of being unable to honour a scheduled appointment.
</li>
<li className=' py-2'>
the Hubbler has repeatedly cancelled appointments at the Hubblees' homes, which the Hubbler had previously accepted.
</li>
</ul>
No later than the time when the restriction comes into effect, Hubbly will send the Hubbler an email specifying (i) the implementation of the restriction measure, (ii) the duration, (iii) the reasons for doing so and (iv) the method in which the Hubbler can provide explanations about the situation.
During this period, the Hubbler will retain access to the Platform and their Account. The Hubbler’s profile will still be available on the Platform for direct Bookings from existing Hubblees and will be offered to new Hubblees but their ranking will be lowered (further to the scoring described in clause 7.2 above). The Hubbler will therefore be less likely to be contacted for Bookings made by new Hubblees during the restriction period.
At the end of the specified period, depending on the Hubblers' performances and the development of the situation, the restriction measure will either be lifted, or the T&C Agreement will be terminated, in accordance with the stipulations in clause 13.3.

<h1 className=' py-2'>13.2.2 Automatic restrictions
</h1>
The Account and Hubbly Services given to the Hubbler will be restricted (as described above in clause 13.2.1) in the following cases:
the Hubbler has not replied to 4 consecutive offers for At-home Services, having had sufficient time to read and reply to them.
the Hubbler has not accepted any of the last 50 offers sent for At-home Services.
<p>No later than the time when the restriction comes into effect, Hubbly will send the Hubbler an email specifying (i) the implementation of the restriction measure and (ii) the reasons for doing so.
During this period, the Hubbler will continue to receive Hubblee Bookings for Hubblees they have already provided At-home Services for. The Hubbler's professional profile will still be online and active, and access to the Platform and their Account will be maintained. Conversely, the Hubbler will no longer be contacted for Bookings made by new Hubblees.
</p>
To lift the restriction, the Hubbler can accept an offer of an At-home Service which they received from an existing Hubblee, or request Hubbly to lift the restriction by writing to Hubbly via the chat box in the Platform or via email to: admin@hubbly.me.

If a dispute remains unresolved Users can contact London Arbitration Centre which is authorised by the Chartered Trading Standards Institute as a certified alternative dispute resolution provider.
